    """MP-140 — what could have produced a finding on this run, published beside the verdict.

    Two INDEPENDENT axes, and an affirmative result needs both: channel availability (did
    the suite and the config arm a detector at all) and run count (could any signal reach
    ALPHA). ``check`` has disclosed both since MP-138; this is the same disclosure on the
    artifact that goes to strangers, which is the surface ADR-0009 governs.

    It applies ADR-0022's principle — a rate quoted without its coverage number is not a
    result — to the number handed to the USER rather than to our own published rate. It is
    NOT what ADR-0022 mandates, and the distinction matters: that ADR chose "ask the engine"
    precisely to avoid a second, subtly different notion of coverage drifting from the
    engine's. This census IS a second notion (structural declaration, not what fired), so it
    inherits ADR-0022's safety property, restated for this surface:

        **No channel the engine actually flagged may be described here as unable to fire.**

    `[M]` a claims review 2026-08-31 caught two violations of exactly that in the first cut,
    both reproduced as published documents that contradicted their own tables:

    - A refusal regression rendered under "**Live:** none. No CI-failing channel … could see
      a change in what the model says", six lines above ``| greeting | ❌ regression | …
      refusal rate 0% -> 100% |``. Refusal is a hard, CI-failing channel
      (``diff/__init__.py:393-398``) and is deliberately absent from
      ``hard_content_channels`` — which is right for deciding a CLEARANCE, and wrong as a
      description of what produced a FINDING.
    - A declared, armed, firing ``must_contain`` assertion appearing in NEITHER list, under
      the same "**Live:** none", above ``| formatted | ⚠️ changed_minor | … violates the
      scenario's text assertions |``. ``hard_content_channels`` excludes assertions because
      ``fmt_drift`` caps at ``changed_minor`` (``diff/__init__.py:428-431``), so they are
      advisory-live, which is a third state the two-list rendering could not express.

    Hence three states, not two, and refusal named in the live list rather than in a footnote
    that reads as an exclusion. The lists are still rendered from the census's OWN ``inert``
    and ``hard_content_channels``, never re-derived, so the terminal, the PR comment and the
    published Report cannot drift into three descriptions of one run.

    Absent entirely when no census was taken — an empty section would read as "we checked and
    everything was live".
