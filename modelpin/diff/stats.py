"""Non-determinism handling for the behavioral diff. See spec section 6C.

Models are noisy: identical input yields slightly different runs. We therefore
compare the candidate *distribution* (N runs) against the baseline *distribution*
and only call something changed when the gap is unlikely to be sampling noise.
This is the core defense of the north-star metric: the FALSE-POSITIVE rate.

The test is an EXACT two-sample permutation test — no SciPy, fully deterministic:
enumerate every way to relabel the pooled runs into two groups of the original
sizes, and measure how often chance alone produces a gap at least as large as the
one observed. Small N (the default 3-5 runs) is enumerated exactly; large pools
fall back to a fixed-seed random sample so the cost stays bounded and reproducible.

Two statistics:
- a difference of means, for binary per-run signals (refusal rate, assertion-failure
  rate) — one-sided, because we only care when the *bad* rate rises;
- total-variation distance between categorical distributions, for tool-call
  sequence keys — two-sided, because any distributional shift is interesting.

A higher p-value means "more consistent with no real change". We flag only when
p is small AND the observed effect clears a minimum size, so trivial-but-significant
jitter at large N never trips an alarm.
