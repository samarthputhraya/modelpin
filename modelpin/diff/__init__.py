"""Behavioral diff orchestrator. See spec section 6.

Combines structural per-run signals (``structural.py``) with the distributional
permutation test (``stats.py``) into a single per-scenario verdict + confidence.

Decision rule (tuned for a low FALSE-POSITIVE rate — the north-star metric):
a signal counts as a regression only when the candidate distribution differs from
baseline at p <= ALPHA *and* the effect clears a minimum size. A single odd run,
or a majority that merely flips between two equally-likely behaviors, is NOT a
regression — the permutation test treats it as noise. The semantic LLM-judge
(``semantic.py``, spec 6B) is optional and injected: with ``judge=None`` this layer
stays purely structural + statistical and never makes a network call; with a judge it
adds a calibrated semantic-divergence signal through the same distributional test.

#: Significance threshold for the permutation test. Lower = fewer false positives.
ALPHA = 0.05

#: A side is UNUSABLE when AT LEAST HALF of its runs recorded nothing: ``2 * d >= n``.
#:
#: The boundary is not arbitrary and it is not a fitted constant. Two of the engine's own
#: quantities break exactly at ``d/n = 0.5``:
#:   * ``modal_sequence`` and the semantic reference output are both ``most_common(1)``, so at
#:     or above half the mode IS "nothing" — the reference every other run is compared against.
#:   * When a healthy baseline meets a candidate with d silent runs, the tool TVD and the
#:     semantic delta are each EXACTLY ``d/n``. Since MIN_TOOL_TVD and MIN_SEMANTIC_DELTA are
#:     both 0.5, ``d/n = 0.5`` is precisely where pure measurement failure begins clearing the
#:     effect-size floors on its own.
#:
#: An earlier draft used a STRICT majority (``>``) on the reasoning that a 50/50 split is
#: noise. [M] That was falsified: at n=8, d=4 the pre-gate engine publishes `regression` at
#: confidence 0.962 about a candidate that recorded nothing on half its runs — the p-gate is
#: the only thing holding the tie, and it stops holding at N>=8. Inclusive `>=` is the only
#: variant that closes that manufactured regression.
#:
#: [A] not [M]: no run in this repo contains a degenerate trace ([M] 0 of 360 real traces in
#: docs/reports/data/), so the boundary cannot be falsified here. MP-54's live calls produce
#: the first d/n distribution via the counters on DiffSignals. ADR-0018 holds the revisit
#: trigger. fp-guardian protected.
DEGENERATE_SIDE_NUMERATOR = 2
#: A tool-call distribution must shift by at least this total-variation distance to
#: count — guards against trivially-significant jitter once N grows large.
MIN_TOOL_TVD = 0.5
#: The ARGUMENT distributions must be fully DISJOINT before the argument gate fires (MP-04).
#:
#: 1.0 is not a fitted dial, it is a structural rule: "no run on the candidate side used a
#: payload any baseline run used." It was chosen over the obvious alternative -- halving ALPHA
#: for the second gate -- because [M] that alternative's meaning is NOT STABLE IN N, and this
#: engine has already shipped two comments stating guarantees that held only at the default N:
#:     N=3  equivalence modes: a fully disjoint change fires at neither (p = 0.100000);
#:          DIRECTIONAL modes differ -- they route through permutation_pvalue_mean, whose
#:          floor is 1/C(2N,N) not 2/C(2N,N), so `--match subset --runs 3` fires at exactly
#:          p = ALPHA. The dead zone is mode-dependent: equivalence N<=3, directional N<=2.
#:     N=4  a fully disjoint change does NOT fire at ALPHA/2 at all (p = 0.028571 > 0.025)
#:          -- ALPHA/2 silently disables this entire signal at a legal `runs` setting
#:     N=5  ALPHA/2 coincides exactly with disjointness (the default, hence the trap)
#:     N>=6 ALPHA/2 fires on NON-disjoint changes (N=6, 5-of-6: p = 0.015152)
#: [M] The floor stated here is exactly "disjoint and significant" at every N in 3..8, and it
#: costs nothing against that alternative: over 72,072 exhaustive relabelings under a true
#: null both land on 916/72072 = 1.2710% (status quo 912/72072 = 1.2654%), both hold the
#: worst pool at 12/252, and both give 0.0722% / 0.1804% on the pure argument-jitter channel.
#:
#: [A] not [M]: no corpus in this repo contains RUN-TO-RUN argument variance -- 5 of 65
#: non-empty tool calls carry arguments at all and all 5 are identical -- so the REAL-WORLD
#: false-positive rate of this signal is unmeasured, and every number above is synthetic.
#: Falsifier: MP-54's live tool scenarios at temperature > 0 flag one scenario whose argument
#: change a human calls equivalent. fp-guardian protected.
#: [M] The equality is exact for every disjoint shape through N=21; at N=22 a genuinely
#: disjoint pool scores 0.9999999999999999 and the gate silently does NOT fire (0 of 199,836
#: non-disjoint pools ever reached 1.0, so the drift is one-directional and false-NEGATIVE).
MIN_TOOL_ARG_TVD = 1.0
#: Ignore refusal-rate rises smaller than this even if "significant" (one run in three).
MIN_REFUSAL_DELTA = 0.34
#: Candidate semantic-divergence rate must exceed the baseline's by at least this much.
#: CALIBRATED on examples/calibration/ (labeled set distinct from the held-out suite; see
#: docs/fp-measurement.md). On the INDEPENDENT-CANDIDATE run of record
#: (`examples/calibration/results/result-independent-judge.json`, candidate gpt-3.5-turbo, judge
#: gpt-4o-mini): equivalent pairs land at delta 0.0-0.20 and the meaning changes that actually
#: took effect at 0.60-1.0, so 0.5 sits in that gap. [M] But 5 of those 6 equivalent pairs score
#: p=1.00 and could not have fired, so the evidence is 0/1 (95% upper bound 95.0%), NOT 0/6 at
#: 39.3% -- that figure was the pre-MP-75 accounting. The "0.0 versus >=0.8" separation quoted here previously
#: is the SELF-JUDGE run, which an adversarial audit demoted as circular -- do not cite it as the
#: justification. [M] `explain_concept` scores 0.20 equivalent / 0.60 changed on the independent
#: run, and `define_term`'s CHANGED pair scores 0.0. The held-out re-validation moved no verdict
#: with the promotion live, but contributed 0 SCORED trials (MP-75/ADR-0022), so it is not
#: evidence for this floor either. NOTE
#: the calibration set is still small and the perturbations synthetic — see docs/fp-measurement.md for
#: the limitations and the planned expansion to real migration traces + an independent judge.

    # 5 candidate runs) flips from `regression` at 0.992 to `unchanged` at 1.0.

    # [A] SYNTHETIC, and labelled as such because it was briefly mismarked [M]: across the
    # 286-pool ENUMERATION 42.98% of name-gate firings go silent under the folded key. On the
    # REAL corpus that figure is 0.00% (0 of 10), because no tracked scenario carries the

    # The gate runs ONLY when the name trajectory is stable on both sides and identical
    # across them. When names are themselves jittery the NAME gate is already the

    # raised error rate. [M] That precondition is what keeps this fix false-positive-neutral:
