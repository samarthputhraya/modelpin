"""Behavioral diff orchestrator. See spec section 6.

Combines structural per-run signals (``structural.py``) with the distributional
permutation test (``stats.py``) into a single per-scenario verdict + confidence.

Decision rule (tuned for a low FALSE-POSITIVE rate — the north-star metric):
a signal counts as a regression only when the candidate distribution differs from
baseline at p <= ALPHA *and* the effect clears a minimum size. A single odd run,
or a majority that merely flips between two equally-likely behaviors, is NOT a
regression — the permutation test treats it as noise. The semantic LLM-judge
(``semantic.py``, spec 6B) is optional and injected: with ``judge=None`` this layer
stays purely structural + statistical and never makes a network call; with a judge it
adds a calibrated semantic-divergence signal through the same distributional test.

#: Significance threshold for the permutation test. Lower = fewer false positives.
ALPHA = 0.05

#: A side is UNUSABLE when AT LEAST HALF of its runs recorded nothing: ``2 * d >= n``.
#:
#: The boundary is not arbitrary and it is not a fitted constant. Two of the engine's own
#: quantities break exactly at ``d/n = 0.5``:
#:   * ``modal_sequence`` and the semantic reference output are both ``most_common(1)``, so at
#:     or above half the mode IS "nothing" — the reference every other run is compared against.
#:   * When a healthy baseline meets a candidate with d silent runs, the tool TVD and the
#:     semantic delta are each EXACTLY ``d/n``. Since MIN_TOOL_TVD and MIN_SEMANTIC_DELTA are
#:     both 0.5, ``d/n = 0.5`` is precisely where pure measurement failure begins clearing the
#:     effect-size floors on its own.
#:
#: An earlier draft used a STRICT majority (``>``) on the reasoning that a 50/50 split is
#: noise. [M] That was falsified: at n=8, d=4 the pre-gate engine publishes `regression` at
#: confidence 0.962 about a candidate that recorded nothing on half its runs — the p-gate is
#: the only thing holding the tie, and it stops holding at N>=8. Inclusive `>=` is the only
#: variant that closes that manufactured regression.
#:
#: [A] not [M]: no run in this repo contains a degenerate trace ([M] 0 of 360 real traces in
#: docs/reports/data/), so the boundary cannot be falsified here. MP-54's live calls produce
#: the first d/n distribution via the counters on DiffSignals. ADR-0018 holds the revisit
#: trigger. fp-guardian protected.
DEGENERATE_SIDE_NUMERATOR = 2
#: A tool-call distribution must shift by at least this total-variation distance to
#: count — guards against trivially-significant jitter once N grows large.
MIN_TOOL_TVD = 0.5
#: Ignore refusal-rate rises smaller than this even if "significant" (one run in three).
MIN_REFUSAL_DELTA = 0.34
#: Candidate semantic-divergence rate must exceed the baseline's by at least this much.
#: CALIBRATED on examples/calibration/ (labeled set distinct from the held-out suite; see
#: docs/fp-measurement.md). On the INDEPENDENT-CANDIDATE run of record (`_calibration_indep.json`,
#: candidate gpt-3.5-turbo): equivalent pairs land at delta 0.0-0.20 and the meaning changes that
#: actually took effect at 0.60-1.0, so 0.5 sits in that gap with 0 false positives in 6 pairs
#: ([M] 95% upper bound 39.3%). The cleaner "0.0 versus >=0.8" separation quoted here previously
#: is the SELF-JUDGE run, which an adversarial audit demoted as circular -- do not cite it as the
#: justification. [M] `explain_concept` scores 0.20 equivalent / 0.60 changed on the independent
#: run, and `define_term`'s CHANGED pair scores 0.0. The held-out re-validation moved no verdict
#: with the promotion live, but contributed 0 SCORED trials (MP-75/ADR-0022), so it is not
#: evidence for this floor either. NOTE
#: the calibration set is still small and the perturbations synthetic — see docs/fp-measurement.md for
#: the limitations and the planned expansion to real migration traces + an independent judge.
