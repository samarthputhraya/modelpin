"""Structural signals for the behavioral diff. See spec section 6A.

Cheap, deterministic, per-run extractions over recorded traces:
- tool-call trajectory, with strict / unordered / subset / superset match modes;
- refusal flags;
- text/format assertion violations.

These turn each run into a comparable signal. The non-determinism handling that
combines N runs into a calibrated verdict lives in ``stats.py`` + ``__init__.py``.
