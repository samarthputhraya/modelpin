## ▶ Resume here (latest — 2026-06-24)

**Phase 0 is essentially complete.** Built, tested, and pushed: OpenAI adapter (live),
Google/Gemini adapter (live-validated, full 8-scenario cross-vendor), Anthropic stub;
semantic LLM-judge; multi-turn replay (agent trajectories); 8-scenario eval suite
(`examples/suite/`); FP-measurement harness. **127 tests pass; ruff + black clean.**

- **DoD met:** held-out FP rate = **0/8 = 0%** (judged), regressions detected. See
  [`fp-measurement.md`](fp-measurement.md).
- **Full 8-scenario cross-vendor DONE:** `mp check` gpt-4o-mini → **`gemini-3.1-flash-lite`**,
  5 runs × 8 scenarios, OpenAI judge on → **8/8 unchanged @ confidence 1.00**
  (tool-call match 1.00, semantic equivalence 1.00, refusal delta 0.00 on every scenario).
  The cross-vendor judge genuinely fired and found the two vendors behaviorally equivalent
  on the held-out suite. Paced at ≤14 Gemini calls/min (under the 15 RPM cap); one transient
  429 was absorbed by backoff. (Earlier smoke: gpt-4o-mini → gemini-2.5-flash-lite, 2 scn.)
- **Two live-surfaced bugs found + fixed (both Gemini-3.x tool-loop):**
  1. *Tool loop aborted on a `400`* — Gemini 3.x requires the opaque `thought_signature`
     (and function-call `id`) to be **echoed back** when a call is fed into the next turn;
     the adapter rebuilt the model turn from scratch and dropped them. Fixed in
     `providers/google.py` `_model_turn_content` (preserve both; omit when absent so the
     2.5 path is unaffected). 2.5 never required this — pure cross-version drift.
  2. *`mp baseline --provider google` crashed on persist* — the (now-preserved) signature
     is raw, non-UTF-8 **bytes** living in `Trace.messages`, which `save_baseline`'s
     `model_dump(mode="json")` couldn't serialize (`UnicodeDecodeError`). Fixed at the model
     boundary (`models.py`): a `field_serializer` base64-encodes any bytes in `messages` on
     dump (round-trips losslessly); in-memory stays raw bytes for the SDK feed-back.
  Both are regression-tested (mutation-verified to have teeth) + live-proven end-to-end.
  An adversarial review workflow also hardened the OpenAI adapter's `tool_call_id` echo test.
- **Git:** branch `feat/openai-adapter-live-path-hardening`, **PR #1**. Working tree has the
  above fixes **uncommitted** (5 files: `models.py`, `providers/google.py`, +3 tests).
  (Note: the "Where we are (main)" section below is the *original* kickoff state.)

**Immediate next steps:** (1) ~~full 8-scenario cross-vendor on `gemini-3.1-flash-lite`~~ ✅
DONE (above). (2) **calibrate** `MIN_*`/`ALPHA` thresholds on real traces — gates promoting
the semantic judge from `changed_minor` to a CI-failing `regression`. (Then: retire stale
`regression_threshold`; subset/superset + cost/latency in the verdict; GitHub Action.)
Full priority list in "Next steps" below.

**How to run live in this environment** (corporate proxy + BYO-key):
- Keys are in `.env.local` (gitignored): line 1 = raw OpenAI key (`sk-…`), a
  `GEMINI_API_KEY=…` line for Gemini. Load both before a run, e.g. parse each line —
  `KEY=VALUE` → that var; a bare `sk-…` → `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
- `pip install` needs `--trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org`.
- The SDKs need the OS trust store, so invoke the CLI through a truststore shim:
  `python -c "import truststore; truststore.inject_into_ssl(); from modelpin.cli import main; main()" <args>`.
- Gemini free-tier **RPM caps** (AI Studio → Rate Limit): 2.0-flash = 0 (unavailable),
  2.5-flash = 5, **2.5-flash-lite = 10, 3.1-flash-lite = 15**. Stay under them (small/paced
  runs); 429 = our rate, 503 = transient Google capacity (retry).

---

## Where we are (branch `main`, pushed to GitHub, private)

- **`33d10d0`** — Phase-0 skeleton + **statistically-hardened behavioral diff** (the moat):
  exact two-sample permutation test (`diff/stats.py`, no SciPy, deterministic);
  verdict gated on `p ≤ 0.05` **and** an effect-size floor (`diff/__init__.py`);
  `strict/unordered/subset/superset` match modes; calibrated confidence.
  Cleanups: Python 3.12, full Apache-2.0 LICENSE, current Anthropic model ids.
- **`f24bd90`** — **CLI wired end-to-end** (`scan/init/baseline/check`), **spec §7 reporter**,
  offline fake-provider demo (`examples/traces/demo_traces.json`), `storage.py`
  baseline persistence, fix for a Windows `UnicodeEncodeError` crash.
- A 13-agent adversarial audit of the diff engine found + fixed **1 CRITICAL**
  (sampling fallback returned `p=0.0`); two proposed "fixes" were verified wrong and rejected.
- **31 tests passing; ruff + black clean.**

Run the offline demo:
```
mp baseline --provider fake --fixtures examples/traces/demo_traces.json \
  --model claude-opus-4-6 --scenarios-dir examples/scenarios --config examples/modelpin.yaml
mp check --to claude-opus-4-7 --from claude-opus-4-6 --provider fake \
  --fixtures examples/traces/demo_traces.json --scenarios-dir examples/scenarios --config examples/modelpin.yaml
```

## Milestone (Phase 0 Definition of Done — spec §11)

`mp check` detects a genuine regression **between two REAL models** and prints the
PR-style report, **with a measured low false-positive rate on a held-out set**.

## The one gap that blocks the milestone

`modelpin/providers/openai.py` is **implemented** (Chat Completions API, BYO-key from
`OPENAI_API_KEY`, SDK import kept lazy, dependency-injectable client). `anthropic.py`
is still a `NotImplementedError` stub.

**Phase A — live-path hardening: DONE.** A two-workflow adversarial sweep (40-agent
discovery + 22-agent review) found 32 confirmed ungraceful-failure modes on the real
`mp baseline`/`mp check` path; the 13 must-fix-before-live-run items are fixed and the
fixes adversarially re-verified (APPROVE). Highlights: every live `openai.*`/adapter
error now becomes a friendly, **key-safe** `ProviderError` (auth errors never echo the
key; all error text is scrubbed of `sk-`/`Bearer` tokens) instead of a raw traceback;
zero-config no longer routes to the Anthropic stub; `--runs <2` is rejected (a single
run can't form a distribution → false confidence); malformed scenario/YAML/baseline
files fail with named, friendly errors; baseline writes are atomic; the CI exit code is
computed before the (now-guarded) report write; skipped no-baseline scenarios are
surfaced, not hidden. **78 tests pass; ruff + black clean.** The 7 deferred items
(stale `regression_threshold`/`judge_model` knobs, mid-run resume, `--fail-on` knob,
baseline model/provider validation, latency/token deltas in CLI output) are Phase B/C.

**Phase A — live smoke run: DONE (first real two-model run).** Ran the full pipeline
live: `mp baseline` on **gpt-3.5-turbo** then `mp check --to gpt-4o-mini` over the 3
bundled scenarios ×5 runs each (BYO-key from a gitignored `.env.local`, ~45 short
completions, pennies). Verdict: 3/3 **unchanged**, PR-style report written. Real traces
for both models are persisted under `.modelpin/` (calibration data). Findings:
- **No false positives on real data (north-star holds).** gpt-4o-mini fired a 2nd tool
  call (`issue_refund`) in 1/5 `refund_request` runs — a real difference — and the engine
  correctly treated the 1-in-5 blip as noise (TVD 0.2 < the 0.5 floor), not a regression.
- **The semantic blind spot is now empirically proven.** On `invoice_parse` both models
  were semantically identical but textually different ("The total amount is $5." vs "5
  dollars."); the structural diff can't see equivalence → **the LLM-judge is the #1 next
  build**, not a nice-to-have. (The bundled `must_contain:["$"]` assertion is noise — "$"
  appeared in 1/5 of gpt-3.5's outputs and 0/5 of gpt-4o-mini's, yet both are correct.)
- **Single-turn replay can't realize multi-step agent trajectories.** `refund_request`
  expects `[lookup_order, issue_refund]` but replay stops after turn 1 (no tool-result
  loop), so the 2nd call rarely appears. Either make agent scenarios single-step or add a
  (mocked) tool-execution loop to replay.
- **Env/ops:** corporate-proxy TLS — the openai SDK (httpx+certifi) fails with
  `CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED`; fixed safely with `truststore.inject_into_ssl()` (uses the
  OS trust store; verification stays ON). Worth a built-in opt-in for corporate users.

The DoD is **not fully closed**: still need a held-out FP measurement (known-equivalent
pairs → false-alarm rate; a known-regression pair → confirmed detection) and the judge.

## Next steps (priority order — re-ordered after the live smoke run)

1. **Semantic LLM-judge — ✅ DONE (built + adversarially reviewed: APPROVE_WITH_NITS).**
   `diff/semantic.py` (Judge protocol + per-run divergence flags vs the modal baseline;
   identical text skips the judge), `judge.py` (`OpenAIJudge`, temp-0, BYO-key, key-safe
   `ProviderError`, FP-safe parse default), wired into the verdict in `diff/__init__.py`
   through the *same* permutation test + an effect-size floor (`MIN_SEMANTIC_DELTA=0.5`).
   It is **optional/injected**: `diff_scenario(judge=None)` stays purely structural and
   offline (CI is $0); the CLI builds a judge only when `judge_model` is set and the
   provider isn't `fake`. An uncalibrated judge escalates only to `changed_minor`, never
   a CI-failing `regression`. `judge_model` is wired in config + sample/example YAML.
   **Before promoting semantic → `regression`:** calibrate the judge on a labeled set
   (a systematically-miscalibrated judge can otherwise emit `changed_minor` false alarms
   at high error rates — bounded, but trust-eroding). Still TODO: retire the stale
   `regression_threshold` config field (deferred item 14).
2. **Replay depth — ✅ DONE.** `OpenAIAdapter.run()` (and the Gemini adapter) now drive a
   model↔tool loop up to `MAX_TOOL_TURNS`, feeding back canned `scenario.input.tool_results`
   so multi-step trajectories (`lookup_order` → `issue_refund`) actually emerge. Deterministic
   + offline-testable.
3. **6–8 real scenarios — ✅ DONE.** [`examples/suite/`](fp-measurement.md) has 8 scenarios
   spanning tool trajectories / semantic / refusal / format, with canned `tool_results` and
   no noisy assertions. `examples/scenarios/` stays as the minimal offline demo.
4. **Held-out FP measurement — ✅ DONE (DoD met).** Live judged run
   (`scripts/fp_measurement.py --model gpt-4o-mini --runs 5`, judge on): **false-positive
   rate = 0/8 = 0%** on the held-out suite (gpt-4o-mini vs itself, all `unchanged` @ conf
   1.00). Detection: both perturbations that actually changed behavior were caught
   (`refund_request`→regression, `classify_sentiment`→changed_minor); the `decline_pii`
   injection was resisted by the model (still declined) so `unchanged` was correct — not a
   false negative. Corroborated by 0/4 (golden), 0/6 (real same-model split-half), 0/3
   (real cross-model). Full writeup in [`docs/fp-measurement.md`](fp-measurement.md).
5. **Calibrate the diff thresholds** (`MIN_TOOL_TVD`, `MIN_REFUSAL_DELTA`, `ALPHA`,
   `MIN_SEMANTIC_DELTA`) on the real traces — replaces today's uncalibrated defaults; gates
   promoting the semantic judge from `changed_minor` to `regression`.
6. **Google/Gemini adapter — ✅ DONE + LIVE-VALIDATED (cross-vendor unlocked).**
   `providers/google.py` via `google-genai` (SDK shapes verified live), BYO-key from
   `GEMINI_API_KEY`/`GOOGLE_API_KEY`, same multi-turn architecture, key-safe errors,
   mock-tested. **Live-validated on `gemini-2.5-flash`:** the text path (correct
   `summarize_ticket` output + token capture) AND the multi-step tool loop —
   `refund_request` produced the full `lookup_order → issue_refund` trajectory and the
   final answer consumed the canned tool data, confirming the `function_response`
   (role="user") feedback is correct. Cross-vendor checks use an OpenAI judge (provider
   inferred from `judge_model`). **✅ FULL 8-scenario cross-vendor run completed:**
   `mp check --provider google --from gpt-4o-mini --to gemini-3.1-flash-lite` over all 8
   suite scenarios ×5 runs, judge on → **8/8 unchanged @ conf 1.00** (tool-call match 1.00,
   semantic equivalence 1.00, refusal delta 0.00 on every scenario; token deltas small/jittery
   and correctly non-gating). The OpenAI judge found gpt-4o-mini and gemini-3.1-flash-lite
   behaviorally equivalent on the held-out suite — "safe to adopt". (Earlier: a 2-scenario
   smoke vs gemini-2.5-flash-lite.) Run paced at ≤14 Gemini calls/min (under the 15 RPM cap);
   60 Gemini calls total, one transient 429 absorbed by backoff. **Two Gemini-3.x tool-loop
   bugs were surfaced + fixed during this run** — (a) `thought_signature`/`id` must be echoed
   back in the loop (else a `400`); (b) those raw signature bytes then crashed
   `mp baseline`'s JSON persist — see the "Two live-surfaced bugs" note in ▶ Resume here.
   The full run is otherwise limited only by Gemini **free-tier RPM** (per AI Studio:
   2.0-flash = 0 RPM/unavailable, 2.5-flash = 5 RPM, **2.5-flash-lite = 10 RPM,
   3.1-flash-lite = 15 RPM**) — use a higher-RPM model + small/paced runs, or enable billing;
   503s are transient Google capacity (clear on retry). **Anthropic** stays a $0 stub until an
   `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` appears.
7. **Corporate-proxy TLS:** the FP harness opts into `truststore.inject_into_ssl()`; still
   worth a built-in opt-in at CLI startup so devs behind an intercepting proxy don't hit a
   `CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED` on first run. Verification stays ON (OS trust store).
8. **Diff deepening (offline-doable now):** cost (token) regression as `changed_minor`
   (gate via the permutation test; latency is jittery — handle carefully); an
   "inconclusive / underpowered → re-run" surface (spec §6C); wire `subset/superset`
   + `expected_tool_calls`/`output_schema` assertions into the verdict.
9. **GitHub Action** polish (`actions/action.yml`) for CI usage.
10. **Smaller audit items:** detector registry-validation (cut regex false positives);
   retire the now-stale `regression_threshold` config field; add the missing per-module
   tests for watcher/report. (Scenario-JSON error handling + config/cli tests: ✅ done.)

## Design guardrails (do NOT undo — see also `~/.claude` project memory)

- Diff confidence for an `unchanged` verdict = `min(p)` is **intentional** (identical
  traces → 1.0; near-α miss → low). Do **not** invert it to `1 − p`.
- The conservative effect-size floors are deliberate for the **false-positive north-star**;
  tune them only with real-trace calibration data, never by guessing.
- BYO-key everywhere; no live paid API calls in tests.
- Public reports are framed as measurement/opinion, never "Model X is worse." Apache-2.0 core.

## Completion & roadmap (estimate — part-time solo dev + AI pair; full-time ~2-3x faster)

- **MVP (Phase 0): ~55-60% done.** Built: full offline pipeline + the hardened, audited
  diff engine + CLI + §7 reporter. Remaining ~40% is the *proof-of-value*: real
  OpenAI/Anthropic adapters, the LLM-judge, a **real two-model run with a measured low
  false-positive rate on a held-out set** (the DoD), 6-8 real scenarios, and Report #1.
- **Public OSS launch (early Phase 1): ~30% done.** pipx/PyPI, a real GitHub Action,
  Watcher automation, the public report site + cadence, and hosted Pro are barely started.

| Milestone | Remaining | Calendar (from now) |
|---|---|---|
| MVP (Phase 0 DoD) | OpenAI adapter -> Anthropic adapter -> LLM-judge -> real 2-model run + FP measurement + threshold calibration -> 6-8 scenarios | ~2-4 weeks |
| Modelpin Report #1 | run open suite on a real model launch, write up, post | overlaps; gated by an actual model launch |
| OSS public launch | pipx/PyPI, real GitHub Action (PR comment via API), docs/DX | ~6-8 weeks |
| First dollars (full Phase 1) | Watcher automation, report site + cadence, hosted Pro | ~3-6 months (~$1.5k MRR) |
| Phase 2 (GitHub App + teams) | FastAPI+Postgres, auto-PR App, dashboard, Stripe | ~6-14 months (~$10k MRR) |
| Phase 3 (business + scale) | managed auto-fix PRs, SSO, more providers | ~14-30 months ($1M ARR) |

Caveats: scales with hours/week; Report #1 is gated by a real provider model launch;
hosted tiers are the heavy lifts. Mirrors the spec's phasing (§11).
