"""A run that could not have reported a regression must not claim it found none (MP-55).

`[M] 2026-08-26` reproduced on the SHIPPED demo, offline, before the fix:

    $ mp check ... --runs 2
    warning: only 2 runs/scenario; 5+ gives the statistical diff real power ...
    OK 4 scenario(s) unchanged                                          exit 0
    last-report.md: "-> No behavioral regressions found; `demo-model-v2` looks safe to adopt."

    $ mp check ... --runs 5          # THE SAME FIXTURES
    REGRESSION angry_customer   REGRESSION refund_request   MINOR invoice_parse

Two regressions and a minor, present in the data both times, reported as "safe to adopt"
because an exact permutation test over C(4,2) = 6 relabelings has a hard p-floor of 1/6 =
0.167 and cannot return anything at or below ALPHA = 0.05. The warning said the run had less
POWER; it did not say the run was incapable of a conclusion, and the report said the opposite.

This is the north-star failure from the false-NEGATIVE side, on the first-run path, in the
demo a brand-new user runs -- and it is the same rule ADR-0018 already draws for a run that
measured nothing, applied one level up to a run that measured but could not conclude.

Deliberately NOT changed here: `MIN_RUNS`, the effect-size floors, and the exit code. Those
are sensitivity surfaces (ADR-0016, ADR-0002) and moving one needs its own calibration and
its own FP review review. This governs only what the tool CLAIMS.
