"""MP-75 - the FP rate must publish whether the run measured anything.

`scripts/fp_measurement.py` reported verdicts only. A scenario the model answers identically
on every run scores `unchanged` and was counted `clean`, so a suite of deterministic
scenarios printed `False-positive rate: 0/8 = 0%` - which reads as "the engine did not cry
wolf" but means "there was nothing to cry wolf about".

`[M]` `diff/stats.py:128-129` early-exits at `p=1.0` when the two sides are DISTRIBUTIONALLY
IDENTICAL, so such a scenario scores `unchanged` REGARDLESS of any change to the engine.
Crediting it to the north-star metric credits a trial that could not have failed.

The exclusion predicate itself is the dangerous part, and `test_measurable` below is the
reason this file exists. [M] fp-guardian blocked the first attempt: it decided from PER-SIDE
variance ("each side is unimodal, so nothing varied"), which is a different claim from
"the sides are identical". Two internally-invariant sides that DIFFER are the engine's
highest-confidence firing configuration, so that predicate deleted the most confident false
positives from both numerator and denominator. It also showed the tests were not pinning the
decision at all: replacing it with `if False:` left all 271 green.

No provider is needed for any of this - ADR-0006 forbids a live call from the suite.
