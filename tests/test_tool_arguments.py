"""Tool-call ARGUMENTS are captured but never diffed (MP-04, spec 6A).

`structural.py:27-29` collapses a run to `tuple(tc.name for tc in trace.tool_calls)` --
names only -- while `models.py:72-74` faithfully stores `arguments` on every ToolCall. So a
candidate that calls the RIGHT tool with a catastrophically WRONG argument reads as
`unchanged` at confidence 1.00: `issue_refund(amount=49.99)` -> `issue_refund(amount=4999.00)`
is a 100x financial error the engine cannot see.

The tool signal is the ONLY place arguments could ever matter: the judge reads `final_output`
(`semantic.py:68-69`), the assertion signal reads `final_output`
(`structural.py:122`), and refusal reads `refused`. When only an argument changes the output
text is identical, so `semantic.py:64` short-circuits and the judge is never even called.

The guard tests below fix the sensitivity ceiling BEFORE the fix raises it: arguments arrive
as a parsed dict whose key order is whatever the model emitted (`openai.py:150` json.loads),
so any encoding that is not order-insensitive turns provider jitter into a false positive --
the one thing this engine must never do. They pass today only because arguments are ignored
entirely; they must still pass afterwards.

The gate ships ADVISORY (ADR-0029): `MIN_TOOL_ARG_TVD` has no labelled calibration set, so an
argument change escalates to `changed_minor` and NEVER to a build-failing `regression` on its
own. That is why the assertions below read `changed_minor` -- a weaker claim than the first
draft of this file made, so the cap itself is pinned separately under "the advisory cap".
