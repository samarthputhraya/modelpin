"""MP-141 -- the channel census is a suite-wide `any()` while blindness is PER-scenario.

MP-138 asked "did ANY scenario in this suite declare `tools`?" and MP-140 published that
answer on the ADR-0009 surface. But `tools` is declared on a SCENARIO, not on a suite, so
one armed scenario spoke for every blind neighbour.

`[M] 2026-08-31`, reproduced end to end through the real CLI on canned offline traces. Two
suites whose two content-blind scenarios are BYTE-IDENTICAL; suite A adds one unrelated
third scenario that declares `tools` and is itself unchanged:

    B (2 blind scenarios):  OK? 2 scenario(s) unchanged
                            "-> ... `demo-model-v2` is NOT cleared on content."
                            last-report.md: "could not measure"
    A (same 2 + 1 armed):   OK  3 scenario(s) unchanged
                            last-report.md: "no behavioral change ... looks safe to adopt."

`[M]` It fires on all three SHIPPED suites -- `examples/suite` 5 of 8 content-blind,
`examples/report-suite` 11 of 14, and the `init --demo` suite a brand-new user runs first
2 of 4 -- so the published Report for the public suite carried an unqualified green
headline over 11 scenarios that had no CI-failing content channel at all.

Two co-located defects in the same row, both fixed here:
  * `render_cli` never called `_underpowered_clearance` (`[M]` grep: only `render_pr_comment`
    did), so a terminal user whose run was blind on RUN COUNT was handed the CHANNEL remedy.
  * `assertions_declared` counted an `Assertion` object the engine never reads.

Deliberately NOT here: nothing under `modelpin/diff/` (FROZEN, ADR-0030). Whether
`expected_tool_calls` should be implemented or deleted is MP-142; this row only stops the
census from COUNTING it as coverage.
