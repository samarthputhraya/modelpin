"""MP-32 - a cloned repo's own config must never become a stranger's config.

The repo root used to hold `modelpin.yaml`, the dogfood config that
`.github/workflows/modelpin.yml` runs Modelpin against itself with. The CLI reads
`modelpin.yaml` from the working directory by default, so in a fresh clone that file WAS
the user's config:

  * `mp init` honours an existing config's `scenarios_dir` (a deliberate fix - see
    CHANGELOG 0.1.2), found 8 scenarios already in `examples/suite`, scaffolded nothing,
    and still exited 0 saying "Already initialised";
  * `mp baseline`, the very next line of README "The real flow, on your own app", then
    replayed Modelpin's own held-out public suite on the user's paid key - 40 replays
    (8 scenarios x runs: 5). In the one recording committed to this repo
    (`.modelpin/baseline-gpt-4o-mini.json`, 2026-06-24) those cost 60 completion calls,
    because three `kind: agent` scenarios drive a 1-6 turn tool loop; that multiplier is
    the model's decision, so treat 60 as an observation bounded by 40-115, not a constant.

These tests pin the user-visible contract, not the remedy: after `mp init`, the scenarios
`mp baseline` bills for are the user's own. They stay valid if the fix later changes shape.
