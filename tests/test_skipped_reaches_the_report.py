"""A scenario with NO baseline must reach the artifact a reviewer reads (MP-160).

`[M] 2026-08-31`, reproduced end to end through the real CLI on canned offline traces.
`check` collects un-baselined scenarios into `skipped`, and that list had exactly one
consumer in the whole package: a console note that runs AFTER `last-report.md` has already
been written. So the scenario appeared in ZERO artifacts -- not the report, not the archived
copy -- while the run exited 0.

    baseline a subset, restore a regressive scenario, check:
        CHECK_EXIT=0
        grep -c angry_customer .modelpin/last-report.md  ->  0

MP-148 gave `rejected` three pieces -- a pre-bucket section, a clearance line, and a place in
the exit condition. `skipped` received none of them.

WHY THIS IS NOT A LITERAL MIRROR OF `rejected`, which is the whole lesson of the row:

  1. `[M]` The clearance line is UNREACHABLE on any run that is not all-clean. Both
     `render_pr_comment` and `render_cli` gate it behind `if regs or minors: ... elif
     unmeasured: ... else: <clearance>`. A clearance-shaped disclosure alone is therefore
     inert on exactly the run where a reviewer most needs it -- a red verdict pronounced
     over a fraction of the suite. The load-bearing piece is the UNCONDITIONAL section that
     renders above the verdict buckets. `[M]` Review BUILT that mirror and ran this module
     against it: **3 of 9 fail** -- the red-run test, the archive test (same red run, so the
     clearance is equally unreachable) and the provenance test. An earlier version of this
     docstring claimed only ONE test discriminated; that was wrong, and understating your own
     guard is still a false claim about a measurement.

  2. `[M]` The remedy is not mirrorable either, which is why this row deliberately does NOT
     add `skipped` to the build-failing exit. Disclose absolutely; coerce never. The argument
     and its revisit trigger live in ADR-0033 -- `test_a_skipped_scenario_denies_the_
     affirmative_clearance` below pins exit 0 and the withheld clearance TOGETHER, so flipping
     the exit code without superseding that record fails this suite.

What DID change about exit codes is a plain bug, not policy: `[M]` with every scenario
un-baselined the command exited **1**, the code that means REGRESSION, over a run that
compared nothing. ADR-0018 says a run that measured nothing abstains.
