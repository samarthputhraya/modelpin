"""User-facing error text must reach the user unchanged (MP-161 + MP-170).

`_fail` renders its message through rich markup with no escaping, so any `[...]` in an error
message is parsed as a style tag. Two failure modes, both `[M] 2026-09-02` reproduced by
calling `cli._fail` directly:

    in : pip install 'modelpin[providers]'
    out: error: pip install 'modelpin'          <- the extra is EATEN

    in : scenario [bold]alpha[/] failed
    out: error: scenario alpha failed           <- SILENTLY REWRITTEN, no exception

The first is MP-161 and it is the worst one in the product: `providers/openai.py` tells a
user whose install lacks the SDK to run `pip install 'modelpin[providers]'`, and the console
prints the command they have already run. It is the FIRST error a stranger without the extra
hits, and it is an infinite loop.

The second is MP-170's sharpened half. A crash at least stops you; this one prints a
plausible message naming something that does not exist and exits as if it had explained
itself. `Scenario.id` has no pattern validator and provider messages are remote text, so
neither is under our control.

`[M]` This class has now been found FIVE times in this codebase, each time at one call site,
and four separate comments have claimed the last one was closed. `_fail_no_scenarios` even
carries a comment explaining the hazard and escaping its own argument -- the symptom patched
where the root cause lives one function away. So the fix is in `_fail` itself, and the local
workaround is removed in the same commit (leaving both would double-escape and print literal
backslashes at the one place that had been careful).

Not covered here: model ids interpolated into markup OUTSIDE error paths (MP-174).
