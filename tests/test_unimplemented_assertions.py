"""No assertion field may exist that the engine does not read (MP-142 -> MP-147).

MP-142 established, by DIFFERENTIAL rather than by grep, that `expected_tool_calls` and
`output_schema` were consulted by nothing -- five trace configurations, verdict/confidence/
explanation byte-identical with the field set and with `assertions=None`:

    baseline SATISFIES exp, candidate VIOLATES (drops issue_refund)  regression @0.992  ==
    baseline VIOLATES, candidate SATISFIES                           regression @0.992  ==
    both SATISFY (no change)                                          unchanged @1.0    ==
    both VIOLATE identically                                          unchanged @1.0    ==
    candidate calls a tool the expectation forbids entirely          regression @0.992  ==

The first and last cases are what make that proof mean anything: an earlier reproduction
used only "both violate identically", which yields `unchanged` whether or not the field is
implemented -- Modelpin measures change RELATIVE to baseline -- so it could not discriminate
the defect it was named for.

**MP-147 deleted them.** That was a decision, not a cleanup: `compute_suite_hash` hashes the
VALIDATED pydantic model, so removing a field moves the content hash of both shipped suites
even though no scenario's MEANING changed. `examples/report-suite` (role `public`, ADR-0009)
is therefore versioned **2.0.0 -> 3.0.0**.

`[M] 2026-08-31`, and worth recording because half of MP-147's own prediction did not
reproduce:

| suite | before | MP-147 predicted | actual |
|---|---|---|---|
| `examples/report-suite` | `sha256:ffd99774f681` | `sha256:eed334061b5e` | `sha256:5cba1dc8b691` |
| `examples/suite` | `sha256:44cbde8e3b74` | `sha256:5482ccd734fd` | `sha256:3edf6b1ae19a` |

The prediction was computed with the fields deleted from the MODEL but the dead keys left in
the JSON FILES, where pydantic silently ignores them. `[M]` Reconstructing exactly that
reproduces `eed334061b5e` for `report-suite` to the digit -- and still does NOT reproduce
`5482ccd734fd` for `suite` (it gives `22a03cce1e6c`), so that half of the row was wrong by
some route this session did not chase. The files were cleaned too, which is the end state a
reader deserves, so the actual hashes are the ones pinned below.

**No measurement was invalidated.** Verdicts are byte-identical either way -- that is exactly
what MP-142's differential proved -- so `docs/fp-measurement.md`'s numbers, measured on the
held-out `examples/suite`, still describe the same behaviour. Only the content fingerprint of
the file set moved, and `fp-measurement.md` cites no hash.

Nothing was lost with the fields. `expected_tool_calls` was redundant with a channel that
WORKS: the tool-trajectory diff measures whether a scenario called the tool it should have,
distributionally over N runs, instead of against a static list.
