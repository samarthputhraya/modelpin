"""Phase-0 DoD harness: measure Modelpin's false-positive rate on a held-out scenario
set, and confirm it still catches genuine regressions.

- False-positive rate: replay a KNOWN-EQUIVALENT pair (the same model vs itself, two
  independent N-run samples) across every suite scenario. Any verdict other than
  `unchanged` is, by definition, a false alarm from model nondeterminism. This is the
  north-star metric ("if Modelpin says it broke, it broke").
- Detection: inject a controlled behavior change into a few scenarios and confirm the
  engine flags it — so a low FP rate isn't just "always unchanged".

BYO-key: reads OPENAI_API_KEY from the environment. Real (cheap) API calls. Run:
    python scripts/fp_measurement.py --model gpt-4o-mini --runs 5
