"""Price the tool-call ARGUMENT gate's added false positives — offline, no API key.

MP-04 shipped a second structural gate defended by an exhaustive enumeration over a
constructed null: `+0.0056 percentage points`, 1.2654% -> 1.2710%. `[M]` **That null carries
two payloads.** The gate fires only when the two sides are payload-disjoint AND each side is
internally concentrated, so a null that fixes the repertoire at 2 prices a different signal
from the one that ships. This script prices it against repertoires this repo has measured
(`examples/calibration/results/arg-repertoire-*.json`). No key, no network call, so it answers
condition 6's dominant term before the gate is ever run live (ADR-0006).

WHAT MAKES THE GATE FIRE — the premise an earlier draft of this file got wrong
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Disjointness is necessary, NOT sufficient, and it is not the dominant term. `[M]` At N=5:

    base a,a,a,a,a  / cand b,b,b,b,b   disjoint, p = 0.0079   FIRES
    base a,a,a,b,b  / cand c,c,c,d,d   disjoint, p = 0.0159   FIRES
    base a,a,a,b,c  / cand d,d,e,f,g   disjoint, p = 0.0873   does NOT fire
    ten pooled distinct payloads       disjoint, p = 1.0      does NOT fire, and is EXCLUDED

`permutation_pvalue_distribution` is relabeling-invariant: at maximum jitter every relabeling
reproduces the observed TVD, p is exactly 1.0, and the gate goes silent. So "more argument
variance is more dangerous" is FALSE at the top end, and the risk lives in the middle — sides
concentrated enough to look decisive, diverse enough across sides to be disjoint.

TWO ESTIMATORS. THE HEADLINE IS THE ONE THAT ASSUMES LEAST
-----------------------------------------------------------
`split_half`  **HEADLINE.** Deal the ACTUAL observed runs into two disjoint sides of N,
              without replacement. No plug-in distribution, no invented tail. Its
              finite-population dependence errs toward OVER-reporting, which is the safe
              direction for a false-positive claim.
`plug_in`     With-replacement resampling from the observed frequencies. Reported for
              contrast only. `[M]` The two disagree on where the N-curve peaks, which is why
              neither may be quoted alone.

`[M]` Both drive the REAL `diff_scenario` and classify with `fp_measurement.classify` /
`measurable` — the repo's own ADR-0022 predicate, never a second copy of it.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT MEASURE. READ BEFORE QUOTING ANY NUMBER
-----------------------------------------------------------
1. `[M]` **One false-positive mode only.** Both sides are drawn from ONE model's own runs, so
   this prices sampling noise against a same-model null. It structurally cannot see the mode
   this repo has already recorded — two different models emitting different-but-equivalent
   payloads (`3.36` vs `3.357` kg, `regression` @ 0.992). That mode is strictly additional and
   remains unpriced.
2. `[M]` **The argument channel in isolation**, not `mp check` as shipped: the synthetic traces
   carry no assertions, no refusal and no judge, so every other channel returns p = 1.0. The
   shipped verdict is an OR across five channels, so the gate's MARGINAL contribution there is
   smaller; the shipped `confidence = min(p)` also moves the ADR-0022 denominator.
3. `[M]` **Three scenarios, not seven.** Four of the seven `arg_*` shapes emit a single payload
   in 16 runs on every model measured and contribute 0 to both numerator and denominator.
   Replicates buy Monte-Carlo resolution, never scenario coverage — MP-105's exchangeability
   caveat carries forward unchanged.
4. `[A]` **Exchangeability is untestable from the committed artifacts.** They store frequencies;
   `arg_repertoire.py` now also stores `payload_sequence` so a future run can test for drift,
   but the runs already committed cannot be checked for it.
5. `[M]` **The plug-in tail is truncated and the bias is NOT sign-determined.** Good-Turing puts
   31-44% of the mass on payloads the 16 runs never saw. Truncation raises within-side
   concentration (helps firing) while lowering cross-side disjointness (hurts firing); the net
   moves the rate by x0.4 to x2.0 depending on the scenario. Nothing here may be called
   conservative.

THE INTERVAL THIS SCRIPT REFUSES TO PUBLISH
--------------------------------------------
No binomial interval over replicates. `[M]` Replicates are draws from an assumed population:
a Clopper-Pearson bound over them shrinks with compute, so it measures spend rather than
uncertainty. Held at a fixed 2.8% point estimate, `upper_bound_95` returns 3.82% at 1,000
replicates and 3.27% at 4,000 — the "bound" tightens because you bought CPU, not because you
learned anything about the world. `[M]` `upper_bound_95` physically refuses the
question — it raises `OverflowError` above n ~= 3,000 — because its `n` is a count of REAL
trials. The uncertainty that matters is the OUTER one: sampling error in the n=16 estimate of
the payload distribution, which does not shrink with replicates. `--outer` measures it by
double bootstrap.

WEIGHTING IS A CHOICE, NOT A MEASUREMENT
-----------------------------------------
`[M]` On one model at N=5 the same data reads 2.70% (replicate-pooled), 2.27% (scenario-mean
over the varying shapes), 3.26% (dropping `arg_optional_fields`) and 0.97% (scenario-mean over
all seven, crediting the four invariant shapes with 0). This script publishes **per scenario**
and prints every weighting, so the choice is visible rather than baked in.

ROLE DISCIPLINE (ADR-0025)
--------------------------
`examples/calibration/arg_*` is role `score`. SCORING the gate against these repertoires is
what they are for. Using them to MOVE `MIN_TOOL_ARG_TVD` would make the threshold in-sample
for the only surface that can measure it. This script imports the constants and never sweeps
them.
